# Conditional Rating Example

Using Angular's structural directives to control the visibility and state of the component.

## Key Directives
- `*ngIf`: Conditional rendering based on permissions or state.
- `[ngClass]`: Dynamic styling based on rating value.

## Why use this?
Ensures the component is only visible when relevant (e.g., after a purchase is completed) and provides visual feedback based on the score threshold.
