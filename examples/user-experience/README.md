# User Experience (UX) & Accessibility

Creating a premium, accessible rating experience.

## UX Tips
- **Dynamic Labels**: Provide immediate verbal feedback (e.g., "Poor", "Good") as the user interacts.
- **Touch Optimization**: Use larger icon sizes for mobile-friendly touch targets.
- **ARIA Support**: Use standard ARIA labels for screen reader compatibility.
